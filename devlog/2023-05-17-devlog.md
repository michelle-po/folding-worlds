## PRESENTATION TEXT

For this project we took inspiration from Greek mythology, in particular the story of the nynph Clhoris and the creation of the Rose.

One day, she was walking as usual in the Isle of Blessed (or more commonly called the Elysian Fields, which represent paradise in Greek mythology), when she met a dead nynph on her way.

Saddened by the fate of the nynph, she wanders around the island, looking for help for the poor girl. She wonders why her sister died, she understands that it is probably the fault of the god of wind, Zephirus. Chloris will also have to be careful, if she hears the wind blowing, she will have to hide or she will die too.
All long the interactions, she will introuce thanks some "internal dialogues" to the user all the hint to continue the story.

By helping the dead nynph, she will be transformed into a beautiful rose and Chloris will be proclaimed goddess of flowers: Flora.
