ALL MORNING BIG PROBLEMS ON MARINE COMPUTER!!
we spent all morning trying to figure out what changed from yesterday that is now causing problems. With douglas we exported from the base project a package with only essential assets and packages to run. We created a new file, imported the XR tools and packages and imported the custom package. Still not working. We disabled openXR desktop and deleted Visual graph package from assets...

WORKING!! Thanks god, but more thanks Pierre :')

In afternoon we started implementing the code on the working scene.

We also recorded the sound effects (check in "audio" folder).

Tomorrow normally we need to continue adding interactions and try to have interactions in VR and not only keyboard inputs. (take the example of the interactions on the table of the hand demo scene and take characteristics)
