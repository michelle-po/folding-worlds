This morning Michelle went to atelier prototypage. We laser-cutted wood the shape for the support of the maquette and some "beans" to make some higher parts on the landscape:

Marine went buy some other DIY materials.

We started playing with all materials, but in particular with paper to create the first flowers:

## FEEDBACK SABRINA:

Add other "islands" where to hide the powers, a sort of "puzzle" of islands that will create the playable space in VR.
