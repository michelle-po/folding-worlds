We tested the scene with a lot of assets to see how the VR will react with a lot of polygons. --> it bugs a lot!

with less assets--> bugs
without herbs --> bugs
without mountains --> ok

whithout mountains + herbs + a lot of assets --> OK !!

We found out a problem with all textures, with multiple maps (normal, occlusion and height) it didn't works. So to have a unique texture we found out we need to re-do the photocatch process but this time with the format RAW as output and select export original. This will allow us to have only one .png as texture.

---> WORKS GREAT
