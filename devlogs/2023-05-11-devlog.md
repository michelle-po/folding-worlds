This morning we looked for some storytelling inspirations behind the interactions. Starting with the meaning of flowers, we arrived at Greek mythology, in particular the life of the nymph Chloris.

"In Greek mythology, Chloris (/ˈklɔːrɪs/; Greek Χλωρίς Chlōrís, from χλωρός chlōrós, meaning "greenish yellow", "pale green", "pale", "pallid", or "fresh") was a nymph/goddess associated with spring, flowers, and new growth, who is supposed to have dwelt in the Elysian Fields."

"Etymology: According to Eustathius of Thessalonica, the word Elysium (Ἠλύσιον) derives from ἀλυουσας (ἀλύω, to be deeply stirred by joy) or from ἀλύτως, synonymous with ἀφθάρτως (ἄφθαρτος, incorruptible), which refers to the life of souls in this place."

"In the tale of the rose, Chloris was walking through the forest when she came across the body of a lifeless wood nymph. Saddened by the nymph's fate, Chloris breathed new life into her body, turning the nymph into a flower. However, a simple flower was not the blooming that Chloris desired. She asked Zephyrus to chase away the clouds so that Apollo's sun could shine its warm presence on this new flowering being. She implored Aphrodite who offered her the flower of her own divine beauty. Dionysus offered a drop of the god's nectar for the intoxicating aroma of the flower. Finally, the Graces, or Charites-Thalia (blooming/flowering), Agleae (beauty) and Euphrosyne (joy) echoed the gifts of the other deities by bringing incandescence, enchantment and gladness. In some accounts, Chloris crowned the rose with a diadem of dewdrops."

"she transformed it into a flower so beautiful that all the gods considered her the queen of flowers"

"Chloris was abducted by Zephyrus, the god of the west wind (which, as Ovid himself points out, is a parallel to the story of his brother Boreas and Orithyia), who transformed her into a deity known as Flora after their marriage."

We tried to represent the life cycle of the flower through this legend and start thinking at the gestures and all interactions with the scene.

In the afternoon, we went to the city center to look for some materials.

## FEEDBACK DOUGLAS:

Too many interactions, history too complicated for now if we include the greek myth literally. Need to be reduce at 1 goal --> create the rose. Take the story as a starting point but it can be simple! For ex. to look into the scene for all the powers of other deus to have all for help the transphormation off the dead nynph.
What will be the shape of the nynph before transformation?
Think about of hide from the wind, gesture! (the danger of the entire experience, what will restart the interaction if not completed in a given time)
