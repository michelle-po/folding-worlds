Big problems with the flower interactions, and we needed Pierre's help.

By the end of the day the flowers were ok, but scaling down in the middle and not on the bottom of the assets, so we have modified the center of the animation for EVERY flower in the scene.

After we tried to add the sounds, so now we have two sounds:

- the nymphe sad who's singing before the transformation,
- the nymphe singing happily after.

This normally will make us understand that something in the scene is ended.

Then we tried and tried again the space of the virtual scene and the physical space we have to be sure for tomorrow we can move better without distance problems.

Other minos problems end we finished.

LAST DEVLOG, GOOD BY WORLD (for now).
