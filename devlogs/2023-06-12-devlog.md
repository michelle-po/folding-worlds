Marine is working on the scene, we need to fix the visual limits for user with fog / grass. Is important to define the limit for the physical space where user can move in real life/VR.

Michelle is working on collider triggering for the sunlight and nymph transformation. Also last scan for clouds.

We tried the scene on the headset, we imported the FPS counter of Pierre and the FPS are really shit (20 max)! we remesh everything, with good textures in C4D. Tested again and now everything is working on the headset (60 FPS)!

We are ready to apply the code logic to the scenography!
