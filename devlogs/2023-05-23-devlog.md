This morning we received the oculus quest 1, but the first settings weren't possible. We tried all the morning but we were stuck on the pairing with the phone application step.

In the afternoon we received an oculust quest 2, so it was possible to put it to developer mode and test it with unity. We tried to import the first scan to unity, build an app and launch it on the VR.
