# Whispering Rose

Project of Michelle Ponti & Marine Faroud Boget </br>
"Folding Worlds", Master Media Design @head Geneve module.

## Description

In this VR experience the user takes on the role of Chloris, a nymph who wanders the Elysian Fields of Greek mythology. While exploring the enchanted landscape, the protagonist, unfortunately, discovers the inert body of another nymph in the vegetation.
Chloris, expressing her thoughts of immense sadness, begins to wonder how her sister nymph could have died so unexpectedly. She blames Zephirus, the wind god, who must have tried to kidnap her in order to make her his wife.
Despite the danger represented by the sound of the wind coming closer, Chloris decides to try and pay homage to the nymph's remains: raising her hands to the sky, Chloris (the user) tries to free the clouds in the sky and make the sun appear, whose rays will warm the nymph.
Unexpectedly, the nymph is magically transformed into a magnificent red rose that blooms.
For her empathetic gesture, Chloris is proclaimed by the other gods to be "Flora, the goddess of flowers". With the landscape transformed and freed by the clouds, Flora will be able to wander through this plant paradise.

## VR Interactions

1. Walking around the scene (physically walking)
2. Touching the other flowers to make you space through the flowers (hand tracking)
3. Clean the sky the cloud above the dead nymph to make the sunlight touch the corpse and make it transforms into a beautiful rose. (pinch the cloud above)
